#FDIC-Failed-Bank-List

Problem Statement:
Since October 2000, numerous banks in the United States have failed, often leading to economic instability, financial losses, and regulatory intervention. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) serves as the appointed receiver for failed banks, yet predicting bank failures remains a critical challenge for financial institutions, regulators, and investors. This project aims to analyze historical bank failures to identify key financial, economic, and operational indicators that contribute to institutional collapse. By leveraging machine learning, statistical modeling, and economic analysis, the project seeks to develop predictive frameworks that can provide early warning signals, mitigate risks, and enhance regulatory oversight. Additionally, this study will examine the impact of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, and economic downturns on the probability of bank failures, offering actionable insights for financial policymakers and industry stakeholders
